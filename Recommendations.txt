Including a feature such as the number of people recently recovered may help provide
insight as to why the daily cases seem to follow a trend of high spikes in infections
followed by a period of low infection. This feature should be limited to only include data as far back as
around two months prior to the day being predicted as this would account for those still
under the effects of antibodies produced after recovering from the disease. Another possible
feature could be the death rate as the number of people who can contract the disease will be
reduced. Lastly, the number of people travelling out of lock-downs might also provide insight
into the infection rate assuming that periods of high infection correspond to periods following relaxed restrictions.
