# Model File Requirements
## Libraries
Install the following:

    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install torch
    pip install requests
    pip install json
    pip install beautifulsoup4

## Usage
At the top of the "main" method, you will find a variable, "load". This variable is defaulted to false, as to train the model. 
If you have a .pth stored in the directory "./models" then you may set that variable to true to use that model.
Simply run the file as follows:

    python final_predictor.py

The file will then train and use the model to predict the next 7 days of new cases and generate the .csv and .png

# Web Application Requirements
## Libraries
Install the following:

    pip install flask
    pip install flask_cors

## Usage
For simplicity's sake, the API endpoint makes use of the .csv file generated by the model file.
In order to API and web application, you must ensure that the .csv file is in the same directory as the API file.
From there, run the API file as follows:

    python endpoint.py

Finally, open the .html file provided.
